# AI Editing Rules

**Rule:**

Do not change any UI element (including shape, size, color, icon, or any other property) unless the user confirms or explicitly requests it. Always confirm with the user before making any visual or functional changes.

*Reason: The user wants full control and to avoid unintended edits. Only make changes that are clearly approved or requested by the user.*
