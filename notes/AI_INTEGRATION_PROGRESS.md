## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### AI Service Configuration
```dart
// lib/services/ai_service.dart
static const String _baseUrl = 'http://104.248.174.119:11434';
static const String _model = 'mistral:7b';
```

### System Prompt Structure
- Intent recognition: create_task, create_reminder, create_expense, create_gym_log, query_data
- Field extraction for each type
- JSON response format enforced

### Response Format
```json
{
  "intent": "create_task",
  "fields": {
    "title": "Task name",
    "dueDate": "tomorrow",
    "timeOfDay": "14:00"
  }
}
```

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS (Tomorrow)

### Priority 1: Main Chat Integration
1. **Connect AI to real user messages** in chat input
2. **Replace test button** with actual AI processing
3. **Parse AI responses** into app models (Task, Reminder, etc.)
4. **Create actual items** from AI responses

### Priority 2: User Experience
1. **Add loading indicators** during AI processing
2. **Show confirmation dialogs** before creating items
3. **Handle missing information** - AI asks for clarification
4. **Error handling** for network issues

### Priority 3: Feature Expansion
1. **Test different scenarios**: reminders, expenses, gym logs
2. **Add more AI capabilities** as needed
3. **Optimize system prompt** for better performance
4. **Consider streaming UI** for faster perceived response

# AI ENHANCEMENT PLANS - December 2024

## üéØ SMART CONVERSATION IMPROVEMENTS

### Current Problem
- AI gives generic, confusing responses instead of understanding intent
- Users get "No task found" when trying to CREATE a task
- Missing fields are listed technically instead of conversationally
- New users don't know how to phrase requests effectively

### Smart AI Response Strategy

#### 1. Intent Recognition + Helpful Feedback
```
User: "I have a doctor appointment tomorrow"
AI: "I'll create a task for tomorrow called 'doctor appointment'. What time is your appointment?"

User: "remind me to call mom"
AI: "I'll set a reminder to call mom. When would you like to be reminded? (Today, tomorrow, specific date?)"
```

#### 2. Progressive Field Guidance
```
User: "create a task for meeting"
AI: "I'll create a task called 'meeting'. When is it? (Today, tomorrow, specific date?)"

User: "tomorrow"
AI: "Perfect! I'll create a task for tomorrow. What time is the meeting?"

User: "2 PM"
AI: "Great! I'll create a task for tomorrow at 2 PM. Should this be high priority?"
```

#### 3. Natural Language Instead of Technical
```
‚ùå "Missing fields: timeOfDay, priority, category"
‚úÖ "What time is your appointment?"

‚ùå "Field 'timeOfDay' is required"
‚úÖ "What time would you like?"
```

### Progressive Teaching Strategy

#### Level 1: Basic Creation (First Time)
```
User: "I have a doctor appointment tomorrow"
AI: "I'll create a task for tomorrow called 'doctor appointment'. What time is your appointment?"

User: "9 AM"
AI: "Perfect! Task created: Doctor appointment tomorrow at 9 AM.
     
     üí° Tip: Next time you can say 'doctor appointment tomorrow at 9 AM' to do it faster!"
```

#### Level 2: Add Priority (Second Time)
```
User: "doctor appointment tomorrow at 9 AM"
AI: "I'll create a task for tomorrow at 9 AM called 'doctor appointment'.
     
     üí° Tip: You can add 'high priority' if it's important, like 'high priority doctor appointment'"
```

#### Level 3: Add Reminder (Third Time)
```
User: "high priority doctor appointment tomorrow at 9 AM"
AI: "I'll create a high-priority task for tomorrow at 9 AM called 'doctor appointment'.
     
     üí° Tip: You can add reminders like 'remind me 30 minutes before' or 'remind me 1 hour before'"
```

#### Level 4: Add Description (Fourth Time)
```
User: "high priority doctor appointment tomorrow at 9 AM remind me 30 minutes before"
AI: "I'll create a high-priority task for tomorrow at 9 AM with 30-minute reminder.
     
     üí° Tip: You can add details like 'need to discuss medical issues' to help you remember what to talk about"
```

#### Level 5: Add Recurring (Advanced)
```
User: "high priority doctor appointment tomorrow at 9 AM remind me 30 minutes before need to discuss medical issues"
AI: "I'll create a high-priority task for tomorrow at 9 AM with 30-minute reminder and notes.
     
     üí° Tip: For recurring appointments, you can add 'repeat weekly' or 'repeat for 4 weeks'"
```

### Smart Field Prioritization

#### For Tasks:
1. **Time** (if missing) - "What time?"
2. **Priority** (for important items) - "Should this be high priority?"
3. **Reminder** (for appointments) - "Would you like a reminder?"

#### For Reminders:
1. **Date/Time** (if missing) - "When would you like to be reminded?"
2. **Advance notice** (for appointments) - "How long before?"

#### For Expenses:
1. **Amount** (if missing) - "How much did it cost?"
2. **Category** (if unclear) - "What category? (Food, Transport, etc.)"

#### For Gym:
1. **Exercises** (if missing) - "What exercises did you do?"
2. **Sets/Reps** (if missing) - "How many sets and reps?"

### Context-Aware Suggestions
```
User: "team meeting"
AI: "I'll create a task called 'team meeting'. When is it?

     üí° For meetings, you might want to add:
     ‚Ä¢ Time: 'at 10 AM'
     ‚Ä¢ Priority: 'high priority' if important
     ‚Ä¢ Reminder: 'remind me 15 minutes before'
     ‚Ä¢ Details: 'discuss project timeline'"
```

### Smart Error Recovery
```
User: "I don't know what to say"
AI: "No worries! Let me help you. Start simple:
     
     Basic: 'doctor appointment tomorrow at 9 AM'
     With priority: 'high priority doctor appointment tomorrow at 9 AM'
     With reminder: 'high priority doctor appointment tomorrow at 9 AM remind me 30 minutes before'
     With details: 'high priority doctor appointment tomorrow at 9 AM remind me 30 minutes before need to discuss medical issues'
     With recurring: 'high priority doctor appointment tomorrow at 9 AM remind me 30 minutes before need to discuss medical issues repeat for 4 weeks'
     
     Start with the basic version and add more details as you get comfortable!"
```

## üé§ VOICE COMMAND IMPLEMENTATION

### Implementation Strategy
- **Extend Current AI** - No new AI needed, use existing Groq API
- **Add Speech-to-Text** - Use Flutter's `speech_to_text` package
- **Reuse Existing Flow** - Same parsing and confirmation logic
- **Add Voice Confirmation** - Text-to-speech or visual feedback

### Technical Implementation
```dart
// 1. Add speech_to_text package
dependencies:
  speech_to_text: ^6.6.0

// 2. Create VoiceCommandService
class VoiceCommandService {
  static Future<String?> convertSpeechToText() async {
    // Speech recognition logic
  }
}

// 3. Add voice button to chat screen
IconButton(
  icon: Icon(Icons.mic),
  onPressed: () => _startVoiceInput(),
)

// 4. Integrate with existing flow
void _startVoiceInput() async {
  final spokenText = await VoiceCommandService.convertSpeechToText();
  if (spokenText != null) {
    _messageController.text = spokenText;
    _sendMessage(); // Existing method!
  }
}
```

### Voice Confirmation Options

#### Option 1: Voice Confirmation Flow
```
User: "Create a task for tomorrow at 9 AM"
AI: "I'll create a task for tomorrow at 9 AM. Say 'confirm' to proceed or 'cancel' to stop"
User: "Confirm" ‚Üí Task is created
```

#### Option 2: Auto-Create with Undo
```
User: "Create a task for tomorrow at 9 AM"
AI: "Task created for tomorrow at 9 AM. Say 'undo' within 10 seconds to cancel"
User: "Undo" within time window ‚Üí Task cancelled
```

#### Option 3: Smart Parsing with Confidence
```
High confidence: Auto-create (e.g., "Create a task called 'buy milk' for tomorrow")
Low confidence: Ask for clarification (e.g., "Did you mean 'buy milk' or 'buy silk'?")
```

### Voice Command Examples
- "Create a task for tomorrow at 9 AM called doctor appointment"
- "Set a reminder to call mom on Friday at 2 PM"
- "Add expense of $25 for lunch today"
- "Create a recurring task every Monday at 8 AM called team meeting"

### Benefits of Using Current AI
- ‚úÖ **No additional costs** - same Groq API
- ‚úÖ **Consistent parsing** - same logic as text input
- ‚úÖ **Fast response** - Llama 3.1 8B is quick
- ‚úÖ **Already tested** - proven to work well
- ‚úÖ **Same features** - priorities, repeats, descriptions
