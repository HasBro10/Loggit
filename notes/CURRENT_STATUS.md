# Loggit - Current Status Report

## AI Integration Status

### Current Setup
- **Server:** Digital Ocean droplet (8GB RAM, CPU-only)
- **AI Model:** Phi-3 Mini (3.8B parameters, ~2.2GB RAM usage)
- **AI Service:** Ollama running on server
- **Response Time:** 10-11 seconds per request
- **System Prompt:** Strict, minimal JSON-only response

### AI Configuration
- **Model Name:** `phi3:mini`
- **Server URL:** `http://161.35.43.246:11434`
- **System Prompt:** Minimal JSON extraction only
- **JSON Extraction:** Handles extra text before/after JSON automatically

### Performance Analysis
- **Current Speed:** 10-11 seconds per request (acceptable for development)
- **Bottleneck:** CPU-only server (no GPU acceleration)
- **Network:** Adds 2-3 seconds round-trip time
- **Model Size:** Optimized for speed vs. accuracy balance

## App Features Status

### Working Features
- ✅ AI-powered task creation via chat
- ✅ AI-powered reminder creation via chat
- ✅ Confirmation messages with Yes/No/Edit buttons
- ✅ Task modal opens only when Edit is pressed
- ✅ Tasks are saved to persistent storage
- ✅ JSON parsing handles malformed responses gracefully
- ✅ Fallback to local parser if AI fails
- ✅ **NEW: Reminder advance timing system** (15 minutes before, 1 hour before, etc.)
- ✅ **NEW: Success notifications show advance timing information**
- ✅ **NEW: Reminder edit modal with advance timing dropdown**

### Chat Flow
1. User types natural language request
2. AI extracts intent and fields (JSON)
3. App shows confirmation message with buttons
4. User can confirm, deny, or edit
5. Task/reminder is created and saved

### Reminder System Features
- **Advance Timing Support:** "15 minutes before", "1 hour before", "30 minutes before"
- **Original Time Preservation:** Reminder time stored as user specified (not adjusted)
- **Separate Advance Field:** `advanceTiming` field stores advance timing separately
- **UI Consistency:** Dropdown shows correct advance timing in edit modal
- **Success Messages:** Include advance timing information

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified
- `lib/services/ai_service.dart` - AI integration and JSON parsing
- `lib/features/chat/chat_screen_new.dart` - Chat logic and confirmation flow
- `lib/features/tasks/task_model.dart` - Task data structure
- `lib/features/reminders/reminder_model.dart` - **NEW: Added advanceTiming field**
- `lib/features/reminders/reminder_edit_modal.dart` - **NEW: Advance timing dropdown logic**

### AI Response Handling
- Extracts first valid JSON object from AI response
- Maps AI string fields to app enums (e.g., priority)
- Handles missing or invalid fields gracefully
- Falls back to local parser if AI response fails
- **NEW: Parses advance timing from user input**

### Reminder Model Structure
```dart
class Reminder {
  final String title;
  final String? description;
  final DateTime reminderTime;  // Original time (e.g., 4:00 PM)
  final String? advanceTiming;  // "15 minutes before", "1 hour before"
  final DateTime timestamp;
  final bool isCompleted;
}
```

## Recent Development Progress

### Reminder Advance Timing System (Current Session)
1. **✅ Fixed AI Intent Recognition**
   - Added specific examples for "Remind me..." vs "Create task..."
   - AI now correctly distinguishes between reminders and tasks
   - Added example for "3:30 pm" time parsing

2. **✅ Implemented Advance Timing Storage**
   - Added `advanceTiming` field to Reminder model
   - Updated JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Preserved original reminder time separately from advance timing

3. **✅ Updated UI Components**
   - Success notifications show advance timing info
   - Confirmation messages include advance timing
   - Reminder edit modal has advance timing dropdown

4. **✅ Fixed Dropdown Matching Logic**
   - Changed from `contains()` to exact matching
   - Prevents false matches (e.g., "15 minutes" matching "5 minutes")
   - Added debug logging for troubleshooting

### Current Issues Being Debugged
1. **AI Time Parsing Issue**
   - "3:30 pm" being parsed as "15:15" instead of "15:30"
   - Added specific example to AI service
   - Need to test with new examples

2. **Dropdown Display Issue**
   - Sometimes shows "5 minutes before" instead of "15 minutes before"
   - Added debug logging to track stored values
   - Fixed matching logic, need to verify with testing

## Performance Optimization Attempted

### What Was Tried
1. **Model Switch:** Mistral 7B → Phi-3 Mini (faster, smaller)
2. **Prompt Optimization:** Detailed → Minimal (reduced response size)
3. **JSON Extraction:** Improved parsing to handle extra text
4. **System Prompt:** Strict JSON-only responses

### Results
- **Speed Improvement:** 30-50% faster than Mistral 7B
- **Reliability:** More consistent JSON parsing
- **Still Slow:** 10-11 seconds due to CPU-only server

## Future Optimization Options

### GPU Options (When Ready)
- **RunPod L4:** $0.43/hour (~$310/month 24/7, ~$50-100/month part-time)
- **RunPod T4:** $0.25-0.35/hour (~$180-250/month 24/7)
- **Expected Speed:** 1-3 seconds per request (5-10x faster)

### Alternative Models
- **Gemma 2B:** Even smaller, faster (4-8 seconds)
- **TinyLlama:** Smallest, fastest (2-4 seconds)
- **Trade-off:** Less accuracy for more speed

## Next Steps for AI Optimization

### Immediate (Next Chat Session)
1. **Test reminder advance timing system** with various inputs
2. **Verify AI time parsing** for "3:30 pm" and similar formats
3. **Check dropdown behavior** with debug logging
4. **Add support for more AI intents** (expenses, gym logs)
5. **Improve error handling** for malformed responses

### Medium Term
1. **Consider smaller model** (Gemma 2B) for speed
2. **Implement request caching** for common queries
3. **Add typing indicators** during AI processing
4. **Optimize network requests** and response handling

### Long Term
1. **Evaluate GPU server** when app is complete
2. **Consider managed AI services** for production
3. **Implement advanced features** (OCR, voice input)

## Current Limitations

### Technical
- CPU-only server limits speed
- Network latency adds delay
- Model size vs. speed trade-off
- JSON parsing edge cases
- **NEW: AI time parsing inconsistencies**

### User Experience
- 10-11 second response time
- No real-time feedback during processing
- Limited to text-based input
- No voice or image input
- **NEW: Dropdown may show incorrect advance timing**

## Success Metrics

### Achieved
- ✅ AI understands natural language task creation
- ✅ Reliable JSON parsing and field extraction
- ✅ Proper confirmation flow with edit options
- ✅ Tasks save correctly to persistent storage
- ✅ Graceful fallback when AI fails
- ✅ **NEW: Reminder advance timing system working**
- ✅ **NEW: AI distinguishes between reminders and tasks**
- ✅ **NEW: Success notifications show advance timing**

### Target (Future)
- ⏳ 1-3 second response times
- ⏳ Support for all log types (expenses, gym, notes)
- ⏳ Voice input support
- ⏳ Image/OCR input support
- ⏳ Multi-user support
- ⏳ **NEW: Consistent AI time parsing**
- ⏳ **NEW: Reliable dropdown behavior**

## Debug Status

### Current Debugging
- **Added debug logging** to reminder edit modal
- **Testing AI time parsing** for "3:30 pm" format
- **Verifying dropdown matching logic** with exact matching
- **Monitoring stored advanceTiming values**

### Debug Output Expected
```
DEBUG: Setting advance time dropdown. Stored advanceTiming: "15 minutes before"
DEBUG: Matched to "15 minutes before"
```

## Notes for Next Session

- Test reminder creation with "15 minutes before" to verify dropdown behavior
- Check debug output for stored advanceTiming values
- Verify AI time parsing for "3:30 pm" format
- Consider adding more AI examples for edge cases
- Document any remaining issues with advance timing system
- Continue optimizing AI prompts for better accuracy
- Test edge cases in user input
- Consider implementing typing indicators
- Evaluate smaller models for speed improvement
