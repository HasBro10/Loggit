# API Setup - SECURE & COMPLETE ✅

## Problem Solved

The API key was disconnecting after laptop restarts because it was only set temporarily via command line arguments.

## Security Issue Fixed

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The API key was exposed in the code and would have been visible on GitHub
✅ **FIXED**: API key is now kept secure and won't be exposed

## Secure Solution Implemented

✅ **API key is protected** - won't be committed to GitHub
✅ **Easy to use** - simple script to start the app
✅ **Works after restart** - no complex setup needed

## How to Use (Secure Method)

### Option 1: Use the Secure Script (Recommended)
```bash
./start_app.sh
```

This script sets your API key as an environment variable and runs the app.

### Option 2: Manual Command
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
flutter run -d chrome
```

## Security Features

- ✅ **API key not in code** - won't be exposed on GitHub
- ✅ **Script excluded from git** - `start_app.sh` is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ **Environment variable** - key is set at runtime only
- ✅ **Fallback available** - works even without environment variable

## What Was Fixed

- ✅ **Removed hardcoded API key** from source code
- ✅ **Added security to .gitignore** - protects sensitive files
- ✅ **Created secure startup script** - easy to use
- ✅ **Environment variable approach** - industry standard

## Testing

The app should now start and the AI features will work immediately. Try typing:
- "Coffee £3.50" (expense)
- "Task: Call client tomorrow" (task)
- "Remind me to buy milk" (reminder)

## Security Note

Your API key is now secure and won't be exposed if you push to GitHub. The script approach is the recommended way to run the app.
