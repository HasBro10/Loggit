# Loggit Current Status

**What's Actually Built vs What's Planned**

---

## ✅ **Phase 1: Expenses MVP** - COMPLETE

### **Core Infrastructure**
- ✅ Flutter project setup with proper folder structure
- ✅ Dark/Light theme switching with ChatGPT-inspired dark mode
- ✅ Local storage using SharedPreferences
- ✅ Responsive design system with custom colors and spacing

### **Chat-Driven Interface**
- ✅ **Chat Screen** (`chat_screen_new.dart`) - Main interface with:
  - Animated typing effect for suggested actions
  - Message parsing for all log types
  - Confirmation prompts with Yes/No buttons
  - Auto-scrolling chat interface
- ✅ **Log Parser Service** (`log_parser_service.dart`) - Handles:
  - Expense parsing: "Coffee £3.50"
  - Task parsing: "Task: Call client tomorrow at 3pm"
  - Reminder parsing: "Remind me to buy milk"
  - Note parsing: "Note: Client prefers calls"
  - Gym log parsing: "Squats 3 sets x 10 reps"

### **Data Models** (All Implemented)
- ✅ **Expense Model** - Amount, category, timestamp
- ✅ **Task Model** - Title, description, due date, priority, status, reminders, recurrence
- ✅ **Reminder Model** - Title, reminder time
- ✅ **Note Model** - Content, timestamp
- ✅ **Gym Log Model** - Exercises with sets, reps, weight

### **UI Components**
- ✅ **Dashboard Screen** - Shows total expenses and recent logs
- ✅ **Tasks Screen** (`tasks_screen_new.dart`) - Full task management with:
  - Task creation/editing modal
  - Priority chips (High/Medium/Low)
  - Status dropdown (Not Started/In Progress/Completed)
  - Category selection
  - Date/time pickers with future-only restrictions
  - Reminder options
  - Search and filtering
  - Sorting by due date, priority, category
- ✅ **Shared Design System**:
  - Color guide (`color_guide.dart`) - Consistent color tokens
  - Spacing system (`spacing.dart`) - Consistent margins/padding
  - Custom widgets: FeatureCardButton, Header, StatusCard, PillButton

### **Storage & State Management**
- ✅ Local storage for all log types
- ✅ Data persistence across app sessions
- ✅ State management using setState (simple but effective)

---

## ✅ **Responsive Design Implementation** - COMPLETE

### **Responsive Utilities** (`lib/shared/utils/responsive.dart`)
- ✅ **Device Detection**: `isMobile()`, `isTablet()`, `isDesktop()` based on screen width
- ✅ **Responsive Font Sizing**: `responsiveFont()` with min/max bounds for scalable text
- ✅ **Responsive Icon Sizing**: `responsiveIcon()` with min/max bounds for scalable icons
- ✅ **Sheet Width Control**: `maxSheetWidth()` for modal sizing
- ✅ **Sheet Padding**: `sheetPadding()` for consistent modal spacing

### **Screens Updated for Responsiveness**
- ✅ **Chat Screen** (`chat_screen_new.dart`):
  - Replaced hardcoded paddings with `Responsive.responsiveFont()` calculations
  - Updated font sizes to use responsive scaling
  - Updated icon sizes to use responsive scaling
  - Fixed FeatureCardButton parameter issues (removed unsupported fontSize/iconSize)
- ✅ **Tasks Screen** (`tasks_screen_new.dart`):
  - Updated header padding to use responsive calculations
  - Updated title font size to use `Responsive.responsiveFont()`
  - Updated icon sizes to use `Responsive.responsiveIcon()`
  - Updated floating action button size to be responsive
- ✅ **Reminders Screen** (`reminders_screen.dart`):
  - Updated all paddings to use responsive calculations
  - Updated all font sizes to use `Responsive.responsiveFont()`
  - Updated icon sizes to use `Responsive.responsiveIcon()`
  - Updated floating action button size to be responsive

### **Responsive Design Principles Applied**
- ✅ **Scalable Typography**: All text scales appropriately for different screen sizes
- ✅ **Adaptive Spacing**: Paddings and margins scale with screen size
- ✅ **Flexible Icons**: Icon sizes adapt to screen dimensions
- ✅ **Consistent Bounds**: Min/max values prevent extreme scaling
- ✅ **Device-Aware**: Different behavior for mobile, tablet, and desktop

### **Testing Results**
- ✅ **iPhone Pro Max 14**: Responsive scaling works correctly
- ✅ **iPhone 12 Pro Max**: Responsive scaling works correctly  
- ✅ **Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra**: Responsive scaling works correctly
- ✅ **iPad Pro**: Responsive scaling works correctly
- ✅ **Chrome Web Emulator**: Responsive scaling works correctly
